# Softworks Trading Co. Design Guide

## Font Recommendations

### Primary Font Family: Montserrat
- **Headings**: Montserrat Bold (700) for main headings
- **Subheadings**: Montserrat SemiBold (600)
- **Body Text**: Montserrat Regular (400)
- **Special Elements**: Montserrat Medium (500) for buttons, CTAs

### Secondary Font Family: Space Mono
- Continue using Space Mono for logo, navigation, and special accent texts (like the existing "How We Deliver Results" heading)
- This creates a nice contrast between the clean sans-serif (Montserrat) and the more technological monospace font

### Typography Hierarchy
- H1: Montserrat Bold, 42px (Hero headline)
- H2: Space Mono Bold, 16px (Section titles like "SOLUTIONS WE OFFER")
- H3: Montserrat Bold, 30px (Section subtitles like "AI-Powered Business Transformation")
- Body: Montserrat Regular, 16-18px
- Button text: Space Mono Bold, 15px

## Image Concepts

### Hero Section
**Concept**: "Neural Network Business Growth"
- An abstract visualization showing interconnected nodes forming both a neural network and a business growth chart
- Dominant colors: Deep blue with red accent nodes highlighting the growth trajectory
- Clean white background with subtle grid pattern suggesting structure and technology
- Alternative: A sophisticated humanoid AI assistant analyzing multiple floating transparent data screens with business metrics

### Solutions Section
**Concept 1**: "AI Integration Icon"
- A minimalist icon showing two distinct puzzle pieces connecting with a subtle glow at the connection point
- One puzzle piece could have circuit-like patterns (representing AI) joining with a more structured piece (representing existing systems)

**Concept 2**: "Workflow Optimization Icon"
- A streamlined process flow diagram with nodes that gradually transform from red (bottlenecks/inefficiencies) to white (optimized)
- Incorporate subtle gears or automation symbols within the flow

**Concept 3**: "Custom Solutions Icon"
- A modular building block structure forming a unique shape
- Each block slightly different, suggesting tailored components
- Some blocks could have small symbols representing different business functions

### AI-Powered Business Transformation Section
**Concept**: "Digital Command Center"
- A wide-angle view of a modern control room with multiple screens displaying data visualizations, AI interfaces, and business metrics
- A diverse team of professionals working collaboratively with the technology
- Subtle colored lighting (reds and blues) to reinforce the brand colors
- Alternative: An abstract 3D rendering of a business building/skyscraper transforming with digital elements flowing through it

### Our Approach Section
**Concept for Title Area**: "Structured Methodology"
- A minimal line drawing showing three interconnected steps in a process
- The drawing could use the red brand color with subtle gradient effects
- Clean negative space to let the text stand out

**Concept for Assessment Phase**:
- Icon: A magnifying glass over data patterns or a detailed radar/spider chart
- Supporting image: Team of analysts in a modern meeting room with interactive screens showing data visualizations, workflow diagrams, and system maps

**Concept for Strategy Phase**:
- Icon: A chess piece (knight or queen) on a simplified strategic grid
- Alternative: A compass or strategic map with various possible paths highlighted

**Concept for Implementation Phase**:
- Icon: A rocket launch representing deployment, or building blocks being assembled
- Alternative: Gears meshing together, representing systems working in harmony
